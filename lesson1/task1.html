<p><strike>Not so long ago</strike> <b>I would have started my morning routine with social networks.</b> Those days, as soon as I lift my head off the pillow to the ringing of alarm clock in my mobile phone, I press the “Dismiss” button and by force of habit open the list of notifications about unread mail, photos on Instagram liked during the night, <i>published on Facebook posts of my friends</i>, dozens of new messages on Telegram and burn the first half an hour of my morning in the name of <u>procrastination.</u></p>

<p align="right">Let’s do some simple math. 30 minutes, 365 days. 10950 minutes of my life and every year I cross them out of time for learning new languages, improving my physical form and reading books.</p>

<p align="center">Sometimes I would have woken up at 3 am from a vague anxiety and first of all grab my phone to check if someone wrote to me or liked the photo of dessert I have made for my girlfriend yesterday.</p>

<p align="justify">
Take into account hourly five-minute breaks for meaningless Facebook scrolling and for reading Twitter during the breakfast to understand why one day I have sat up and asked myself, “How could I change everything?”.</p>
